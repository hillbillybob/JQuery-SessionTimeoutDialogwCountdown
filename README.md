# JQuery-SessionTimeoutDialogwCountdown
This is a JQuery dialog box with countdown functionality to handle session timeouts, warning the user with a countdown, and committing the timeout upon completion.

This project is a VS2015 solution, but the JS and CSS files are cross platform so use as needed. I am a .NET dev so by default I gravitate to those kinds of project
